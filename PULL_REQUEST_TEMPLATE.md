### How Has This Been Tested?

- [ ] I have tested the sketch in-circuit in DCS with DCS-BIOS and outputs (displays, LEDs, etc.) function as expected. 
- [ ] I have tested the sketch in-circuit in DCS with DCS-BIOS and HID inputs (switches, pots, etc.) function as expected, with switches moving the correct direction.
- [ ] I have tested the sketch in-circuit in DCS with DCS-BIOS and any logic in the sketch has been tested and functions as expected.
- [ ] This code has not yet been tested in-circuit.
- [ ] This code has not yet been tested in DCS-BIOS.
